# Merkle-Tree

Merkle Root Implementation in Python, the script assumes data is given by the user and each transactions hash value is calculated

Currently supports calculating the merkle root

The main script basically focuses on to get the Root hash!!!

If the nodes at any level are odd, then it replicates the last value to the hashes list.

The hashing Algorithm used is SHA-256 i.e a builtin function in hashlib
